Please read the **COPYRIGHT** notice of the bottom of this page. If you contribute to this repository, then you agree to the **CONTRIBUTOR LICENSE AGREEMENT** also at the bottom of this page.

# Overview

Contribute to Swamp Cinema here! How to:

- 'Fork' this repo. This creates a copy of it you have edit permissions of.
- Clone your forked repo into garrysmod/addons (so it creates garrysmod/addons/contrib), edit it, and push it back. You'll need the GitHub desktop or commandline client. Look up GitHub tutorials for that.
- For clientside work, check out the [devtools](https://github.com/swampservers/contrib/blob/master/lua/swamp/dev/cl_devtools.lua) which allow you to work on the actual server environment.
- Make a pull request on this repo. Use the 'compare across forks' link to request to merge your changes on your forked repo to this repo. Accepted changes are installed automatically, although new files won't run until after a server reset.
- Minor, single-file changes can just be done in the web browser by clicking the pencil icon.

All models/materials/sounds in this repository will be automatically uploaded to our workshop addons, so don't worry about that.

# Code

- Please submit code that is **clean and concise**. You may want to run it through [glualint](https://fptje.github.io/glualint-web/). Do a good job! 
- Make your code compatible with our [loading system](https://github.com/swampservers/contrib/blob/master/lua/autorun/swamp.lua).
- Try to put cinema-specific code in gamemodes/cinema/ and generic (cross-server) code in lua/. Both folders are loaded using our loading system.
